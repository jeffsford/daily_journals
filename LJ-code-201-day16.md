<h1>Learning Journal - Day 16>

Today was a productive first day of project week.  We had several branch related issues, but we're learning more about how to resolve them and it didn't stop us from getting a lot done. It was also good in terms of working on a project as a member of a team. Different team members have different ideas about how things should be done. We navigated that challenge well one day one.
