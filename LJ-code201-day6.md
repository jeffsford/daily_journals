<h1>LJ Code 201 - Day 6</h1>

Today was a day that really demonstrated how much I have to learn.  We covered functions, methods, and objects, as well as the document object model.  The lab assignment is very challenging, and I struggled to build the objects in javascript for most of the afternoon.  The instructors and fellow classmates were very helpful in explaining how different code works, but I still have some catching up to do on the assignment.
