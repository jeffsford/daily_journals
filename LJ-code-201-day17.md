<h2>Learning Journal - Day 17</h2>

My most significant lesson today was one that shows the importance of attention to detail in coding, as well as communication with team members when working on a project. I was working on javascript for a page that someone else created yesterday. When I finished the code, it wouldn't run. I spent a couple more hours trying to figure out what the problem was, and eventually someone realized that there was another form above the section I was working on in the html. All I had to do was change my form index from [0] to [1].
