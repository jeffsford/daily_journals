<h2>Learning Journal - Day 18</h2>

Today was a productive day.  Our site is fully functional now, and we're putting the finishing touches on it.  I think I learned a little more about version control though the issues we faced today. I prepended elements for the first time today, in order to make our comments appear in the order we wanted.  I also had the opportunity to get more experience with CSS while trying to make our pages look the way we want.
