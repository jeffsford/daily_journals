<h1>LJ Code 201 - Day 8</h1>

It was interesting to learn about forms today, and I am still trying to fully understand events in javascript.  That being said, I was able to understand of what was covered today, and the lab today was fun to accomplish. I have learned a lot through the labs this week, and the morning code review sessions have been equally as helpful.
