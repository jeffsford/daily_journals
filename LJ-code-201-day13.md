<h1>LJ Code 201 - Day 13</h1>

We experienced a lot of problems with merging branches prior to our lab today, so I learned more about resolving those issues today.  I was also able to help a couple of fellow students who were having trouble completing yesterday's lab.  It was nice to explain something that took me a while to understand, and reinforced the information for me. I am still not totally understanding the localStorage coding.
