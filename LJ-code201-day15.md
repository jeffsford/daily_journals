<h2>Learning Journal - Day 15</h2>

Today's class was good preparation for next week. I appreciated the emphasis on working in an ordered manner as a team. It is also important that we not make assumptions what members of our team know or do not know. The merge conflict lab gave us a little window into the personalities on our team, and should help us out when we start coding on Monday morning.
