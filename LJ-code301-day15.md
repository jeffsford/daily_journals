# LJ Code 301 - Day 15

The biggest takeaway from class today was the time that we spent with our project week groups. We were able to get a good amount of planning done after the lecture. Having to present our plans to Nick and the TAs forced us be pay attention to detail. We will all be doing some research on elements of the project this weekend, and should be able to hit the ground running on Monday.
