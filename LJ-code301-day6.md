# LJ Code 301 - Day 6

Today's lab assignment was challenging for my partner and me, but we were pleased when we learned in code review that we were much closer to complete than we had realized. I didn't see the reading listed until it was too late to read before class, so I wasn't as prepared for the lecture material as I would have like to have been. It's obviously significant stuff, so I look forward to working with it.
