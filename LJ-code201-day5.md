<h1>LJ Code 201 - Day 5</h1>

Brian Nations was our substitute teacher today and we learned about CSS colors, text, and images. It was good to dig a little deeper on these topics than we had previously. The larger perspective that he brought was also very helpful. He said that you can never stop learning in this industry, and we shouldn't get discouraged by not understanding things at a given time. The additional git instruction was much appreciated.
