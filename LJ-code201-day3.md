<h1>LJ Code 201 - Day 3</h1>

In the lecture portion of today's class, we covered CSS boxes and that gave me a greater understanding of their importance. We also got an introduction to loops in javascript. Loops were a challenge for me in the pre-work, so it was very beneficial to work with them today. Our lab assignment was very challenging. We used loops to notify users when a question incorrectly answered, and asked them to answer the question again. This was helpful, because it demonstrated a simple application of what loops can do.
