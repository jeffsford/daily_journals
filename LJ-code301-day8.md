# LJ Code 301 - Day 8

Code review was good today. It was a situation where we knew what code needed to be entered, but it became clear that most of us didn't know why. The new material introduced today working with databases. It sounds like the new lab assignment will be a challenging one, but I feel like a learned a good amount today.
