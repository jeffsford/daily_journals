<h2>Learning Journal - Day 20</h2>

Today was a satisfying end to the 201 class. The day started with our team having to work through some issues with the page. We were able to go through a final rehearsal with Hadiya and another guy (I didn't catch his name), and that was very helpful. They helped us focus on what would make the presentation more effective. You can always to better, but I was pleased with the final presentation.
