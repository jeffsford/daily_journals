# LJ Code 301 - Day 10

Today we continued working with databases, specifically databases with more than one table. I'm still trying to fully grasp databases. The code involved seems like some of the most straightforward language that we have used, so I think that I'll just have to work with them a bit for it to be truly comfortable with it. In the afternoon we watched the final presentations by the graduating 401 class. It was interesting to see the range of topics that the groups chose to work on.
